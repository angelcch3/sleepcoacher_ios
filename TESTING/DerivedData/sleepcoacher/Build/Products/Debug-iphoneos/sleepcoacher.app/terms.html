<p><strong>Protocol Approval Date: January 14, 2015</strong></p>
<p><strong>Protocol Expiration Date:&nbsp;Jan</strong></p>

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION: </strong>You are invited to participate in a Brown University research study on your experience with our SleepCoacher app. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether or not this tool can clearly, and accurately provide users with valuable information and recommendations regarding their own sleep habits. You will be asked to install and use the SleepCoacher app. You will also be asked to provide your occupation, age, gender, and whether you share a bed with a pet or partner. The app may send you notifications with recommendations for ways to improve your sleep. You might receive these recommendations either as notifications through the app, or as text messages or as emails. You will be given the choice of whether you prefer text message or email, but if your preferred method doesn&rsquo;t work, we will send you notifications through the other method. Throughout the study, you will be asked to answer survey questions about the quality of your sleep. You must also enable GPS-tracking on your phone. You might be asked to give us extra feedback on your experience and the SleepCoacher app. Your feedback will be analyzed in conjunction with your usage activity from the Sleep App tool (including nightly data on light, noise, and movement collected by the app while you sleep), and all data collected will be both anonymous and stored on password-protected Brown servers.</p>
<p>You must be 18 years or older to participate, have no known sleep disorders, and agree to provide your age, gender, occupation, phone carrier, whether you take sleep medication, GPS-location, and you agree to follow the recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>TIME INVOLVEMENT: </strong>Using the app will take approximately 5 minutes per day.</p>
<p><strong>RISKS AND BENEFITS: </strong>There are minimal risks associated with this study: if you alter your sleep habits, you might experience a slight decrease in alertness. The feedback you give may help improve the SleepCoacher app so that is better able to make recommendations about user sleep patterns. Receiving text messages might incur a cost that is not covered by us. The project investigators might benefit from this application in the future, but we cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from future distribution.</p>
<p><strong>PAYMENTS: </strong>You will not receive any payment as compensation for being a part of this study. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PARTICIPANT&rsquo;S RIGHTS: </strong>If you have read this form and decided to participate in this project, please understand your participation is voluntary and you have the right to withdraw your consent via email or discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. If you choose to withdraw, you have to uninstall the application from your phone. You have the right to refuse to answer particular questions. The results of this research study may be presented at scientific or professional meetings or published in scientific journals. Any mention of participants will be anonymized for the sake of privacy.</p>
